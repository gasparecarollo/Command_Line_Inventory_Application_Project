Command-line Inventory Application Project 


Welhhh-uuhh-come..gulp..ahh (oh, gawd that was 8 year old whiskey I found in Jerry's trophy room).. uhh Welcome to Rick and Morty's err... Smoke[yourEnemies] cough.. cough.. Shop. 

Hey Morty, take the helm while I take care of these.. uhh... where's my..? ahhh

WWHAT'S UP MY GLIP GLOPS!" Welcome to Rick and Morty's Smoke[yourEnemies] Shop.

Alright, Morty, listen up! I'm gonna need you to bring together all that fancy knowledge you've gathered so far, you know, about JavaScript and building applications. We're gonna build something truly groundbreaking hereâ€”a Command-line Inventory Application! It's gonna be an application where all those mindless employees can keep track of the inventory of their little store.
Here's the deal, Morty. With this application, these numbskull employees can create new items, update existing ones, check out a list of items, get the nitty-gritty details on a specific item, and even delete items. It's gonna be like having a personal inventory assistant right in their hands, Morty!
But hold on, Morty, we gotta spice things up a bit. This application needs to have a particular resource or theme, you know, to give it that extra zing! Let's name it something appropriate, like... umm... how about "Interdimensional Inventory Tracker"? Yeah, that'll catch their attention!
So, Morty, get ready to dive into some hardcore coding. Put those JavaScript skills to use and create the most mind-blowing Command-line Inventory Application that'll make those employees go, "Wubba lubba dub dub!" Let's show 'em what we're made of, Morty!


Alright, listen up, you simple-minded mortals! I'm gonna guide you through the process of getting this project up and running on your pathetic local machines. Pay attention and try not to mess it up!
First things first, you're gonna need a few prerequisites. And no, I'm not talking about some fancy gadgets or interdimensional gizmos. We're gonna keep it simple for your puny brains. You need something called npm, which stands for Node Package Manager. Don't worry about what it means, just follow my lead.
Open up your command line and type in the following command:

``` npm install npm@latest -g ```


That's gonna fetch and install the latest version of npm for you. Just sit back and let it do its thing. And don't ask me why it's called npm@latest, Morty, it's just how they do things in this ridiculous tech world.
Now that you've got npm all set up, it's time for the installation process. Brace yourselves, this is gonna be mind-blowingly simple. Trust me, I've seen parallel universes collapse, this is nothing.
All you need to do is follow this example command to install and set up your app. And guess what? You don't need any external dependencies or services for this. It's just you and your computer, Morty.
So, here it is:

```npm install ```

All right, listen up, you bunch of interdimensional code monkeys! I'm gonna show you how to install two amazing packages for your Node.js projects. Get ready to blow your minds with chalk and nanoid!
First things first, we need to fire up your terminal. Open it up and get ready to conquer the npm universe.
To install chalk, type in the following command and hit enter:

``` npm i chalk@4.1.0 ```

Bam! Just like that, you've added some serious color to your life. Chalk is a package that lets you add beautiful and customizable colors to your console output. Now you can make your command line interface look like a psychedelic space adventure!
But we're not stopping there. Oh no, we're taking it to the next level with nanoid. To install this mind-blowing package, type in the following command:

``` npm i nanoid@3.3.6 ```


Rick Sanchez:

 Alright, listen up, Morty! I'm gonna teach you how to use these CRUD commands to mess around with your precious items. So pay attention, Morty!

To destroy an item, you're gonna need to run the command `npm run destroy` followed by either the `"id"` or the `"weaponName"`. Yeah, you heard me right! You can either use the item's ID or its name to obliterate it from existence. Just make sure you know what you're doing, Morty. Destruction can be pretty messy.

Now, if you wanna create an item, you'll use the command `npm run create` followed by a series of parameters. First, you'll enter the `"weaponName"`, then the `"description"`, followed by the `"price"`. And hey, don't forget to mark `"True"` for both `"inStock"` and `"availableInYourDimension"`. We don't want any missing items in your dimension, Morty!

When it comes to updating an item, buckle up, Morty, 'cause it's gonna be a wild ride! You'll need to run `npm run update` and provide a bunch of arguments. First, the `"weaponName"` to identify which item you want to update. Then you'll enter the `"itemSku"`, `"description"`, `"price"`, `"inStock"`, `"availableInYourDimension"`, and finally, the `"weaponId"`. It's a lot to remember, Morty, but you'll get the hang of it.

But let me tell you something, Morty. Playing around with these CRUD commands can have consequences. You gotta be responsible, Morty. Destroying, creating, and updating items can have a big impact on your dimension. So use these powers wisely and be prepared for any consequences that may come your way. Got it, Morty?


That's it! Just run these commands, and your app will be installed and ready to go. Can you believe it, Morty? It's almost disappointingly easy, but hey, I'm not complaining.
Now, go forth and conquer the world with your app. Or at least try not to break it, because I won't be there to clean up your mess. Good luck, Morty. You're gonna need it.
