WWHAT'S UP MY GLIP GLOPS!" Welcome to Rick and Morty's Smoke[yourEnemies] Shop.

Bringing together all you've learned so far, about JavaScript and building applications, build a Command-line Inventory Application. It will be an application where employees can keep track of the inventory of a store. Employees can create new items, update items, see a list of items, see details of one item and delete items. Your application should choose a particular resource or theme and be named appropriately.
